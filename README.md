# HelloWorld

# Overview

This is my Hello,World beginning program.

This was pretty easy to do since when you start a C# project and build it in Visual Studio Code, that is what is in the starter Program.cs.

# Development Environment

Some of the tools I used to develop this was old programs I have written so that I could get everything I needed in my program to work properly.

I used C# language which is a C based language. I started learning C# in November 2023. It was totally foreign to me at the time but has since become easier.

# Useful Websites

* [W3Schools: C#](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php) I did not copy this code. It auto generates when you build the beginning program.
